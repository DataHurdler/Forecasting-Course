"""check-book-claims.py — the two hand-written pages in two generated books.

Everything in the book and the workbook is assembled by `build_book.py` /
`build_workbook.py` from the decks, labs, assignments and narration, so a number
in a chapter cannot disagree with the material it came from — it is never copied,
it is read on every build. The prefaces are the exception. They are authorial
prose, written once by hand, and they make claims about the volume they open.

That is not a reason to stop writing them by hand: the specific numbers are what
make a reader keep going, and a preface with nothing checkable in it is duller and
no more true. It is a reason to check what they claim. book/index.qmd has already
carried one stale sentence.

So each claim below is bound to its source on disk. A claim whose regex no longer
matches is a FAILURE, not a skip — a preface reworded until it says nothing is
exactly how coverage disappears quietly.

    python3 scripts/check-book-claims.py

Exit 0 = every claim matched and every claim is true. Runs in ./scripts/backtest.sh.
