# ▶ SLIDE 1 — Title page

Lecture 5: Tree Ensembles.

Last week ended on a complaint. A single decision tree is unstable — change a few training
points and the whole structure changes. I called that a fatal weakness.

Today we do something that should feel slightly perverse. We are going to take that
instability and turn it into the source of the method's strength.

**[pause]**

Two families, and they attack opposite problems. **Bagging and random forests** attack
variance, by averaging many trees built in parallel. **Boosting** attacks bias, by building
trees sequentially where each one fixes what the last one got wrong.

By the end you'll have the method that, on most tabular business data, is simply the best
thing available.

# ▶ SLIDE 2 — Lecture Outline

Five parts. From single trees to ensembles. Bagging. Random forests. Feature importance. Then
gradient boosting and XGBoost.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 3 — Section divider: From Single Trees to Ensembles

Part one, and it starts with an observation that has nothing to do with statistics.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 4 — The Wisdom of Crowds

In 1907, at a county fair, eight hundred people guessed the weight of an ox.

Francis Galton collected the guesses expecting to show that the crowd was foolish. Individually
they were — almost nobody was close.

But the **average of all eight hundred guesses** came within one pound of the true weight.

**[pause]**

Why does that work? Because the errors were *independent*. Some people guessed high, some low,
for unrelated reasons, and averaging cancelled them.

Now transfer that to models. A single decision tree is noisy — it splits somewhere slightly
arbitrary and everything downstream inherits that arbitrariness. But if you train many trees on
different versions of the data, each is noisy in a *different* way. Average them and the noise
largely cancels while the signal, which they agree on, survives.

**[pause]**

I want you to notice the word doing all the work: **independent**.

Galton's crowd worked because the guesses were unrelated. If eight hundred people had all
overheard the same wrong estimate, averaging would have gained nothing.

Hold onto that. The entire difference between bagging and random forests — the whole reason
random forests exist — turns on that one word.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 5 — Section divider: Bagging

Part two. Bootstrap aggregating.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 6 — Bagging: The Big Idea

Three steps.

Draw **B bootstrap samples** — sample your training data with replacement, same size as the
original. Because it's with replacement, each sample gets some observations twice and misses
others entirely. That's the point: each sample is a slightly different view of the data.

Fit one deep tree on each. Deep — we're not pruning. We *want* each tree to be low-bias and
high-variance, because averaging is about to handle the variance.

Then average all B predictions.

**[pause]**

Now the equation, which is the most important thing on this slide.

The variance of the averaged forecast is **rho sigma squared, plus one-minus-rho over B, sigma
squared**.

Two terms. Look at what happens as B — the number of trees — grows.

The second term has B in the denominator, so it shrinks toward zero. That's why more trees
never hurts.

The first term has no B in it at all. It does not move.

**[pause]**

So you have a **floor at rho sigma squared**, where rho is the pairwise correlation between the
trees' predictions.

Read what that says. If your trees are highly correlated — rho near one — the floor is near
sigma squared, and averaging a thousand of them buys you essentially nothing. You have grown a
thousand trees and reproduced one.

That's Galton's crowd overhearing each other.

And it's exactly the problem the next section solves.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 7 — Out-of-Bag Error

A pleasant side effect of bootstrapping.

Each bootstrap sample draws n observations with replacement, so some get picked more than once
and some not at all. Work through the probability and you find each sample contains about
**sixty-three percent** of the distinct training points.

Which means roughly **thirty-seven percent are left out** of any given tree. Those are the
out-of-bag observations.

**[pause]**

Here's the trick. For observation *i*, collect predictions only from the trees where *i* was
out-of-bag. Average those. Compute the RMSE across all observations.

Every one of those predictions came from a tree that **never saw that observation**. So the OOB
error is an honest out-of-sample estimate — and you got it without setting aside a validation
set or refitting anything. It falls out of the bootstrapping you were doing anyway.

In sklearn it's one argument: `oob_score=True`.

**[pause]**

One caution, and it's the one that matters for this course.

Below about a thousand observations, OOB gets noisy — each observation is out-of-bag for too
few trees, so its OOB prediction is an average over a small, unstable set.

Our weekly series have two hundred seventy-seven observations. That is well under a thousand.
So on this data, use proper walk-forward cross-validation. OOB is a genuine convenience on
large datasets and a trap on small ones, and business time series are almost always small.

# ▶ SLIDE 8 — Section divider: Random Forests

Part three. Decorrelating the trees.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 9 — The Problem Bagging Does Not Fully Solve

Back to the floor.

Why would trees end up correlated? Because of the greedy algorithm from last week. At the root,
CART picks the single best split. If one feature is clearly the strongest predictor, then
*every* tree picks it, and every tree starts the same way.

And in forecasting, one feature is essentially always dominant — last year's value, or last
week's. So this isn't an edge case. It's the normal situation.

The trees end up near-identical. Rho stays large. Bagging buys you very little.

**[pause]**

The Random Forest fix, from Breiman in 2001, is almost absurdly simple.

At each split, don't consider all p features. Consider a random subset of **m**, and take the
best split among *those*.

That's it. That's the whole method.

**[pause]**

Think about what it does. Sometimes the dominant feature simply isn't in the candidate set. The
tree is forced to find its second-best story — and then a third tree finds a different one.
Across hundreds of trees you get genuinely different structures. Rho falls, and the floor falls
with it.

And here's the part I find genuinely elegant: **you are deliberately making each individual
tree worse in order to make the ensemble better.** Any single random forest tree is a poorer
model than a single bagged tree. It was handicapped. But the ensemble beats it, because the
handicap bought independence.

That is one of the more counterintuitive ideas in applied statistics, and it works.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 10 — Random Forest Hyperparameters

Five parameters, and the striking thing is how few need attention.

`n_estimators` — number of trees. More is better and plateaus around five hundred. There is no
overfitting risk from adding trees; that's the first term of the variance equation, which
doesn't care.

`max_features` — **this is the one that matters.** It's m from the previous slide. It is the
dial controlling rho, and therefore the dial controlling the floor. Lower means more
decorrelated trees. The `'sqrt'` default is a reasonable starting guess, not a law.

`max_depth` — leave it at None. We want deep trees.

`min_samples_leaf` — raise it to about five for smoother predictions.

`oob_score` — set True if your dataset is large enough for it to mean anything.

**[pause]**

Start with five hundred trees, `sqrt` features, `min_samples_leaf` of five.

And note the practical consequence: essentially one parameter needs real tuning. Compare that
to what's coming with XGBoost, where you'll be juggling six. A large part of why random forests
are the right default is that they are very hard to misconfigure.

Set `random_state=42`. A forest is random twice over — in the bootstrap samples *and* in the
feature subsets — so without a seed your results move between runs and you'll waste an hour
wondering why.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 11 — Section divider: Feature Importance

Part four. Which predictors matter?

---

# ▶ SLIDE 12 — Random Forest Feature Importance

Mean decrease in impurity. For each feature, sum the variance reduction across every split
where it was used, weighted by how many observations passed through that node. Normalize to one.

On our CA_1 food sales the ranking comes out: **four-week lag at zero point four five**, last
week at zero point one eight, same week last year at zero point one one, and **SNAP benefit
days at zero point zero eight** — ahead of price.

**[pause]**

That SNAP result is worth pausing on. Nobody told the model that food sales spike when benefits
are disbursed. It found it, and ranked it above price. That is a real business finding, and no
linear specification would have surfaced it unless someone already suspected it.

**[pause]**

But read this as a screening device, not an explanation, because **MDI is biased**.

The bias is toward features with many possible split points. A continuous variable like price
offers hundreds of thresholds to try. A binary flag offers one. The continuous variable gets
more chances to look useful — not because it carries more signal, but because it had more
opportunities.

`permutation_importance` is the honest alternative: shuffle one column and measure how much
accuracy falls. If shuffling it doesn't hurt, it wasn't doing anything. That's a direct
measurement rather than an accounting artifact.

Use MDI to narrow forty candidates to eight. Use permutation importance before you put a
ranking in front of anyone who'll act on it.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 13 — Random Forest in Python

The code is four lines, and the results table is the interesting part.

On CA_1 food sales, fifty-two week test: seasonal naive at **1,660**. A single deep tree at
**1,415**. The random forest at **1,020**.

**[pause]**

Two things.

The forest cuts RMSE about **twenty-eight percent** against the single tree. That's the variance
reduction, bought purely by averaging — same algorithm, same features, five hundred of them
instead of one.

And it is the **first method in this course to beat the seasonal naive benchmark on this
series.** In Homework 1 you found that exponential smoothing couldn't. ARIMA couldn't either.
This does, comfortably.

**[pause]**

Now — be careful about the conclusion you draw, because the obvious one is wrong.

What changed is not that random forests model time series better than ARIMA. It's that we gave
this model **information the others never had**: lags, price, SNAP days, event flags. ETS and
ARIMA only ever saw the series' own history.

That's the real lesson of the second half of this course. The gains from here are coming
substantially from feature engineering, not from model sophistication. A random forest with one
lag feature would lose to ARIMA. A random forest with a well-built feature set wins.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 14 — Section divider: Gradient Boosting

Part five, and we change direction entirely.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 15 — Boosting vs. Bagging: The Core Difference

Bagging builds trees **in parallel** and independently. Each tries to predict y directly.
Averaging reduces variance. And critically — adding more trees never reduces bias. If your
trees are systematically wrong in the same direction, averaging preserves that exactly.

Boosting builds trees **sequentially**. Each new tree fits the *errors* of everything built so
far. That reduces bias as well as variance — and it can overfit, which bagging essentially
cannot.

**[pause]**

The intuition on the slide is the clearest version I know.

Forecast one says fifty thousand dollars. The actual is sixty thousand. The error is plus ten
thousand.

Now, forecast two does not try to predict sales at all. It tries to predict **that error**. It
says: "the first model was short by about ten thousand."

Add them together: fifty plus ten is sixty.

**[pause]**

Each stage corrects what remains. And notice this fixes something averaging cannot touch — if
every bagged tree under-predicts December by the same amount, the average under-predicts
December. Boosting sees that residual pattern and builds a tree specifically for it.

Bagging attacks variance. Boosting attacks bias. That sentence is the whole slide.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 16 — The Gradient Boosting Algorithm

Formally, three steps in a loop.

Start with the mean. Then repeatedly: compute the residuals, fit a shallow tree to those
residuals, and add a fraction of that tree to the running prediction.

**[pause]**

Two design choices worth understanding.

**The trees are deliberately shallow** — depth three to six. That's the opposite of bagging,
where we grew them deep. Here each tree only needs to capture a small piece of the remaining
error, so a small tree is enough. A deep tree would fit the residual noise, and the next
iteration would be trying to correct noise.

**The learning rate eta is the main dial.** After fitting a tree to the residuals, you don't add
the whole thing — you add eta times it, where eta might be zero point zero five.

Which means you deliberately under-correct at every step.

**[pause]**

Why on earth would you do that?

Because each tree is fitted to the residuals of one particular sample, so part of what it sees
is noise. Take the full correction and you bake that noise in. Take five percent of it, five
hundred times, and the noise averages out while the signal accumulates.

The reliable recipe is: small eta, many trees, and **early stopping**. Without early stopping,
boosting will keep reducing training error until it has fitted your noise perfectly. Unlike
bagging, this method genuinely can overfit — and it will if you let it.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 17 — Section divider: XGBoost

The version that won everything.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 18 — XGBoost: Three Advances

Three improvements over vanilla gradient boosting.

**The Newton step.** Vanilla boosting uses the gradient — the direction of steepest descent.
XGBoost also uses the second derivative, the curvature. Knowing how sharply the loss is bending
lets you take a better-sized step, so it converges in fewer trees.

**Explicit regularization.** This is the important one. XGBoost puts penalties directly in the
objective — gamma on the number of leaves, lambda on the magnitude of the leaf weights. So
overfitting is controlled by the loss function itself, not only by stopping early.

**Column subsampling.** Borrowed straight from random forests: sample features per tree and per
split. The decorrelation idea from slide nine, imported into boosting.

**[pause]**

Notice what that second advance actually is.

`reg_lambda` penalizes the sum of squared leaf weights. That is an **L2 penalty** — it is Ridge
regression, applied to leaf weights instead of regression coefficients. And `gamma` penalizes
the count of leaves, which is what LASSO does to nonzero coefficients.

You are seeing next week's lecture, one week early, wearing different clothes.

That's not a coincidence. Regularization is not a linear-model topic. It is how *every* flexible
model is kept honest, and you'll meet it a fourth time in Lecture 7 as weight decay and dropout.

**[pause]**

XGBoost dominated Kaggle tabular competitions from 2014 to 2018. LightGBM is faster on large
data; CatBoost handles categorical features natively. The ideas are the same.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 19 — XGBoost: Key Hyperparameters

Six parameters, against the random forest's one that mattered. This is the cost of the extra
accuracy.

Number of trees, five hundred to two thousand — high, because you're pairing it with early
stopping. Learning rate zero point zero one to zero point one. Depth three to six, shallow.
Row subsample and column subsample around zero point eight. And `reg_lambda`, the Ridge penalty
on leaf weights.

**[pause]**

The two that interact most are `learning_rate` and `n_estimators`, and they trade off directly.
Halve the learning rate and you need roughly twice the trees. Small eta with many trees is
almost always better than large eta with few — you're just paying for it in compute.

Practical starting point: learning rate zero point zero five, depth four, a thousand trees with
early stopping on validation RMSE. Then tune depth and subsample by `TimeSeriesSplit`.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 20 — XGBoost in Python

The code, and one argument that matters more than it looks.

`eval_set` is what makes `early_stopping_rounds` work. XGBoost watches RMSE on that set and
halts when it stops improving. That's how you get away with setting a thousand trees — you're
not committing to a thousand, you're setting a ceiling and letting the data decide.

**[pause]**

And the validation set has to respect time. Build it with `TimeSeriesSplit`, hold out the final
stretch as a true test set, and never let a random split choose which weeks the model sees.

If you use a random split here, early stopping will pick the iteration that best predicts weeks
the model has effectively already seen. You'll stop too late, ship an overfitted model, and your
diagnostics will look excellent.

**[pause]**

One practical note that will save you an evening. On macOS, `xgboost` needs the OpenMP runtime.
If you get an error about `libomp.dylib` not loading, run `brew install libomp`. The Python
package installs fine and then fails at import, which makes it look like a code problem when
it's a system library problem.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 21 — Section divider: Key Takeaways

Let's pull it together.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 22 — Tree Methods: Which One When

Three rows.

Decision tree — single tree, highly interpretable, minimal tuning, baseline accuracy.
Random forest — parallel, medium interpretability, low tuning, good accuracy.
XGBoost — sequential, low interpretability, higher tuning, best accuracy.

**[pause]**

My advice is that **random forest is the better default**, and I want to be clear about why,
because "XGBoost is best" is what the accuracy column says.

A random forest is robust, needs almost no tuning, and hands you OOB error for free. It is
genuinely hard to make one catastrophically wrong.

Move to XGBoost when you can afford to tune and you need the last few points. And budget for
that tuning honestly — an untuned XGBoost frequently loses to a default random forest. The
accuracy in that column is the accuracy of a *well-tuned* XGBoost, and that word is carrying
weight.

**[pause]**

And the warning box applies to every row.

Neither can **extrapolate**. A tree predicts the mean of a leaf, and no leaf contains values it
never saw. On a trending series, both flatten out exactly when you need them to keep climbing.

We put a number on that last week: CA_1 food sales grew twenty-nine percent over five years.
Train on the first four, and the highest number a tree can output is a leaf mean from the older,
lower range.

So the classical methods did not become obsolete today. If your series trends and you need to
forecast beyond its historical range, an ARIMA with drift will do something a forest simply
cannot.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 23 — Lecture 5: Key Takeaways

Five things.

**One.** Ensembles work because independent errors cancel. The word independent is load-bearing.

**Two.** Bagging averages B trees on bootstrap samples. Variance falls as B grows but floors at
rho sigma squared. Random forests subsample features at each split to cut rho — the key gain
over plain bagging.

**Three.** OOB error is free cross-validation — but it needs a large dataset, and ours is not.

**Four.** Boosting inverts the idea. Trees built sequentially, each fitting what remains.
Bagging attacks variance; boosting attacks bias. XGBoost adds a Newton step, explicit
penalties, and column subsampling.

**Five.** Tune by cross-validation, always with `TimeSeriesSplit`, and pair boosting with early
stopping.

**[pause]**

And one thing that isn't on the slide. The jump from ARIMA to random forest on our data was
large — sixteen sixty down to ten twenty. Most of that came from the feature set, not the
algorithm. Remember that when you're tempted to reach for a more complicated model instead of a
better predictor.

# ▶ SLIDE 24 — References

Reading is ISLP section 8.2 — bagging, random forests, and boosting — plus the XGBoost
"Introduction to Boosted Trees" tutorial, which derives the regularized objective we waved at
on slide 18.

Next week: Regularization and Model Selection. We take the penalty idea that showed up inside
XGBoost and give it a lecture of its own.

See you then.
