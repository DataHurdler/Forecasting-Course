## How to use this document

- **`▶ STEP n — Title`** matches the lab's own headings exactly.
- *Italic parentheticals* are stage directions. **[pause]** is a beat; **[STOP — learner works]**
  is where you tell the viewer to pause the video and do something.
- Numbers are the lab's real output, verified reproducible across repeated runs. Prophet uses
  MAP estimation rather than MCMC here, so it is deterministic — no seed required.
- Nothing here is sacred. If a sentence doesn't sound like you, change it.

### Two corrections to the lab text, folded into this script

1. **Step 2** says two harmonics cut the error "by roughly a factor of three." It is
   **3,428 → 1,348**, a factor of **2.5**. The script says two and a half.
2. **The closing** says the simpler model "was competitive." pyGAM does not merely compete —
   it **wins**, 3,444 against Prophet's 3,935, about 12% better. The script says so, because
   understating your own result trains students to do the same.

Neither changes the lab's argument. Both are worth fixing in the `.qmd` when you next touch it.

### In-room language that needs replacing

The closing **Discuss** block. Converted below to a discussion-board prompt.

# ▶ OPENING

*(Screen: rendered lab, top of document.)*

Lab 3, and we're leaving the Walmart data.

Lecture 3 made a specific claim: a GAM earns its keep when a series has **several cycles running
at once**, because each cycle gets its own smooth term and you can still read the model
afterward. Retail sales can't demonstrate that. They have essentially one season — Christmas —
and one season doesn't need a GAM.

So today: electricity demand. Three large cycles running simultaneously, and an annual shape
that will break the first model we try.

The business framing matters for how you read the results. You're forecasting daily demand for a
grid operator, and being wrong is expensive in **both** directions. Under-forecast and you're
buying power at spot prices during a peak. Over-forecast and you've paid to keep generation
spinning for nothing. Hold that asymmetry — it comes back in the closing question.

**[pause]**

You need `prophet` and `pygam` installed, and `electricity_daily.csv` plus
`electricity_hourly.csv` from `prep_electricity.py`. Run that once.

# ▶ SETUP

*(Screen: run setup.)*

```
2041 days — train 1673, test 368
test window: 2017-08-01 to 2018-08-03
```

Two notes. We trim to 2013 onward — five and a half years, which is plenty of annual cycles and
keeps every fit under a second, because you're going to fit several. And we hold out just over a
year, August 2017 through August 2018, so the test window contains a full summer *and* a full
winter. That's deliberate. Holding out only six months of an annual cycle tells you almost
nothing.

The `logging` line silences Prophet, which is otherwise extremely chatty on every fit.

---

# ▶ STEP 1 — Three cycles, one series

*(Screen: run the three-panel figure.)*

Before any model, look at the three periodicities separately.

*(Point at each panel in turn.)*

Hour of day: demand bottoms out around four in the morning and peaks in the early evening,
around hour nineteen. People wake up, go to work, come home, turn things on.

Day of week: Monday highest, Sunday lowest. Commercial and industrial load.

Day of year: and this one is a strange shape, which is the whole point of Step 2.

*(Run the swing cell.)*

```
hour of day    swing  33.3%   min   4   max  19
day of week    swing  11.6%   min   6   max   1
day of year    swing  44.7%   min 116   max 200
```

**[pause]**

All three are large. The annual swing is forty-five percent of mean demand, the daily swing is
thirty-three percent, and even the weakest — day of week — is nearly twelve percent. None of
these is a rounding error you could ignore and still have a usable forecast.

That is the situation Lecture 3 said GAMs are for. Not one dominant season with noise around it.
Three real cycles, all worth modelling, all on different time scales.

---

# ▶ STEP 2 — The annual cycle has *two* peaks

*(Screen: point back at the third panel.)*

Look at that annual panel again. It does not look like a wave. It looks like a letter M.

*(Run the January/April/July cell.)*

```
January  (days 1-31)     34,403 MW   <- heating
April    (days 95-115)   26,945 MW   <- mild, nothing running
July     (days 180-200)  37,043 MW   <- air conditioning
```

**[pause]**

There it is. High in January, low in April, high again in July. Two peaks and two troughs per
year — because heating and cooling are **both** electricity demand, and they happen at opposite
ends of the calendar. April is the month when nobody needs either.

Now the consequence, and this is the argument for the whole lecture. Fit that annual shape with
a single sine wave. Then with two.

*(Run the harmonics cell.)*

```
one harmonic     in-sample RMSE 3,428 MW
two harmonics    in-sample RMSE 1,348 MW
```

A single sine wave has one peak per cycle. **It can put that peak in summer or in winter — it
cannot do both.** Whichever it picks, it is badly wrong for half the year. Three thousand four
hundred megawatts of error on a series averaging around thirty thousand.

Add a second harmonic — a cycle that repeats *twice* a year — and the error drops to thirteen
forty-eight. Two and a half times better, from one extra pair of terms, because that second
harmonic is exactly the shape the physics needs.

**[pause]**

That's the mechanism. Prophet's `yearly_seasonality` is this idea with more terms — a Fourier
series of order ten by default, so ten sine-cosine pairs. A pyGAM spline gets there differently,
by bending freely rather than by summing waves, but it's solving the same problem: the annual
shape is not a wave, so don't fit it with one.

---

# ▶ STEP 3 — Prophet, and an honest benchmark

*(Screen: run the Prophet cell.)*

Prophet wants two columns named `ds` and `y`. That is genuinely most of the API.

But benchmark first — always. Same day last year, and note it's **364** days rather than 365,
which keeps the weekday aligned. Comparing a Tuesday to a Wednesday would hand the benchmark an
error that isn't really about seasonality.

```
Seasonal naive (364d)    RMSE   4,608   MAE   3,333
Prophet                  RMSE   3,935   MAE   3,001
```

Prophet beats the benchmark — about fifteen percent better on RMSE.

One deliberate choice: `daily_seasonality=False`. The data is one row per day, so there is no
within-day variation left to model. Leave it on and Prophet will happily fit a daily cycle to
noise, and report it to you with a straight face.

---

# ▶ STEP 4 — The components plot

*(Screen: run `m.plot_components(fc)`.)*

This is the payoff, and it's why Prophet gets used by people who have to defend a forecast in a
meeting.

*(Point at each panel.)*

Three panels, one per additive term, each on the scale of the original series. The trend. The
weekly cycle. The yearly cycle. Separately readable, and each one is a sentence you can say to a
non-technical person: *"demand is drifting down slightly, Mondays run about a thousand megawatts
above Sundays, and there are two annual peaks."*

**[pause]**

And look at the yearly panel — it reproduces the double peak from Step 2. Nobody told Prophet
about heating and cooling. Nobody coded a January term and a July term. The Fourier series simply
had enough flexibility to find the shape that was in the data.

That combination — flexible enough to find it, structured enough to show you what it found — is
the entire case for additive models.

---

# ▶ STEP 5 — How much did the extra harmonics buy?

Step 2 made this argument in-sample, on the averaged annual profile. That's suggestive, not
evidence. Test it properly, on the holdout.

`yearly_seasonality` takes an integer — the Fourier order — instead of `True`.

**[STOP — learner works]**

Pause here. Fit a Prophet with the yearly order forced to **1** — a single harmonic — and add it
to the results table. Everything else stays the same.

*(Screen: after the pause, run it.)*

```
single harmonic RMSE 4,269
```

**[pause]**

Four thousand two hundred and sixty-nine, against three thousand nine hundred and thirty-five for
the full-order model. The holdout agrees with Step 2 — crippling the annual term costs you real
accuracy out of sample, not just in-sample fit.

But look where it lands relative to the benchmark. Seasonal naive was 4,608. The single-harmonic
Prophet is 4,269 — it beats the benchmark by about seven percent, and that is *all* it beats it
by.

And here's the part worth stopping on. **On MAE, it loses to the benchmark outright** — 3,358
against 3,333. Same two models, same holdout, opposite verdict depending on which error measure
you quote.

That is not a trick and it is not a bug. RMSE squares errors, so it punishes the occasional large
miss; MAE treats all errors proportionally. A model can be better on one and worse on the other,
and when a ranking flips between them the honest move is to say so rather than to quote the
metric that flatters you.

---

# ▶ STEP 6 — pyGAM, and reading the smooth directly

*(Screen: run the pyGAM cell.)*

Prophet is a GAM with the time-series decisions already made for you. pyGAM makes you state the
terms yourself — more work, more control.

Two terms only. A cyclic spline on day-of-year — `basis="cp"` is what makes December 31st join
back up with January 1st, so the smooth doesn't have a discontinuity at the year boundary — and
day-of-week as a categorical factor.

That's it. No trend term. No hourly anything.

```
effective degrees of freedom: 22.5

                          RMSE    MAE
pyGAM (doy + dow)         3444   2550
Prophet                   3935   3001
Prophet (yearly order=1)  4269   3358
Seasonal naive (364d)     4608   3333
```

**[pause]** — *let the table sit.*

Every model beat the benchmark. The single-harmonic Prophet is the worst of the three, as Step 2
predicted.

And **pyGAM wins.** Thirty-four forty-four against Prophet's thirty-nine thirty-five — about
twelve percent better, on both RMSE and MAE, using two terms against Prophet's three, with no
trend component at all.

That should bother you slightly, and we'll come back to it in the closing question.

*(Screen: run the partial dependence plots.)*

Now the partial dependence — the GAM equivalent of the components plot.

*(Point at the left panel.)*

**Say what the left panel means in words**, the way you'd say it to a grid operator: demand is
high in January, falls through spring to a minimum around mid-April, climbs to an annual peak in
mid-July, and falls again into autumn. The model learned the M shape directly from the data by
bending, without being given a single Fourier term.

And say the other thing too: **the confidence band widens where the data is thin.** Look at the
edges. That widening is the model telling you where it is guessing, and a forecast that comes
with an honest statement of its own uncertainty is worth more than a point estimate that doesn't.

---

# ▶ BEFORE YOU LEAVE

*(Screen: the closing callout.)*

**[STOP — learner works]** — *(replaces the in-room "Discuss")*

Post these in the Week 3 thread before Lecture 4.

**First, the awkward result.** pyGAM was given two things: day of year and day of week. Prophet
was given a trend, a weekly cycle, *and* a yearly cycle with ten harmonics. Prophet has strictly
more machinery — and it lost by twelve percent.

Give me one reason a more flexible model can lose on a held-out year. And name the thing you
would check before concluding that pyGAM is genuinely the better choice here, rather than luckier
on this particular holdout.

**Second, the operational question.** Your forecast is for a grid operator who must buy
generation in advance, and the two directions of error cost different amounts. Under-forecast and
you buy at spot during a peak. Over-forecast and you've paid for spinning reserve you didn't
need.

Which of these models would you actually ship — and what would you need to know before you could
answer that at all?

**[pause]**

Notice that nothing in the table we just built answers the second question. RMSE and MAE are both
symmetric — they charge you the same for being a thousand megawatts high as a thousand low. If
the costs aren't symmetric, neither metric is measuring the thing you care about.

That's not a flaw in this lab. It's the gap between forecast accuracy and forecast *value*, and
it's worth carrying into the rest of the course.

Solutions for the coded parts go up on Canvas after the deadline. See you in Lecture 4, where we
start on trees.

# Appendix — expected output

Reproducible; verified bit-identical across repeated runs. Prophet uses MAP estimation, not MCMC.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Data | 2,041 days (train 1,673, test 368), 2017-08-01 → 2018-08-03 |
| Swing — hour of day | 33.3% (min hour 4, max hour 19) |
| Swing — day of week | 11.6% (min Sunday, max Monday) |
| Swing — day of year | 44.7% (min day 116, max day 200) |
| January / April / July | 34,403 / 26,945 / 37,043 MW |
| One harmonic, in-sample | 3,428 MW |
| Two harmonics, in-sample | 1,348 MW (**factor of 2.5**, not 3) |
| pyGAM (doy + dow) | RMSE 3,444 · MAE 2,550 |
| Prophet | RMSE 3,935 · MAE 3,001 |
| Prophet (yearly order = 1) | RMSE 4,269 · MAE 3,358 |
| Seasonal naive (364d) | RMSE 4,608 · MAE 3,333 |
| pyGAM effective d.o.f. | 22.5 |

**Two things to know before recording.**

*The MAE inversion is real and worth keeping.* Seasonal naive has a **better MAE** (3,333) than
the single-harmonic Prophet (3,358) while having a worse RMSE. It is the only metric disagreement
in the table and it makes the point about symmetric loss concretely, so do not smooth over it.

*pyGAM beating Prophet is a genuine result, not a fluke of rounding* — it wins on both metrics by
roughly 12%. The honest caveat, which is what the closing question is fishing for, is that this
is a single held-out year. Walk-forward validation over several origins is what would settle it,
and that is Lecture 1's lesson arriving again one lecture later.
