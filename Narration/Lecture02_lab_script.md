# Lab 2 — Recording Script

**ECON 8310: Business Forecasting · Stationarity, ARIMA, and Granger Causality**

Lab: `Labs/Lecture02_lab.qmd` (6 steps) · Measured runtime: **~26 minutes** of narration
(the in-room version is budgeted at 40)

## How to use this document

- **`▶ STEP n — Title`** matches the lab's own headings exactly.
- *Italic parentheticals* are stage directions. **[pause]** is a beat; **[STOP — learner works]**
  is where you tell the viewer to pause the video and do something.
- Numbers in this script are the lab's real output, verified reproducible. **One exception,
  flagged in Step 3:** the ARIMA order is a student choice, so their RMSE will differ from
  yours. The script handles that explicitly — do not read a number there as if it were the
  answer.
- Nothing here is sacred. If a sentence doesn't sound like you, change it.

### In-room language that needs replacing

Three spots: Step 2 (*"say it out loud to the person next to you"*) and the two **Discuss**
blocks in the closing. This script converts all three to a pause plus a discussion-board prompt
and flags each divergence from the `.qmd`.

# ▶ OPENING

*(Screen: rendered lab, top of document.)*

Lab 2. Two ideas from the lecture, and today you get to watch each one bite.

The first is a rule: **test for stationarity before you read an ACF.** The second is a caveat:
**Granger causality is not structural causality.** Both sound like the sort of thing you nod at
in a lecture and skip in practice. So we're going to do exactly that and watch it go wrong.

The business question starts small. You're forecasting weekly household demand at store CA_1,
and you want to know whether watching the food aisle helps predict it.

Then in Step 6 we leave the store entirely and run the same test on a macro question — does
unemployment predict retail sales? — and you'll find the answer depends on which years you
include. Not slightly. Completely.

**[pause]**

You need two prepared files this time: `m5_weekly.csv` from `prep_m5.py`, and
`fred_monthly.csv` from `prep_fred.py`. Run both once from the repository root before you start.
The FRED one caches to disk, so there's no network call and no API key.

---

# ▶ SETUP

*(Screen: run the setup cell.)*

Same pattern as Lab 1 — imports, a path helper, a series accessor, a split.

```
277 weeks — train 225, test 52
```

Same store dataset, different store and same category as Lab 1: CA_1 household. Fifty-two weeks
held out.

The one new import worth noticing is `redirect_stdout` from `contextlib`, and `io`. That's not
statistics — that's damage control, and I'll show you why in Step 5.

---

# ▶ STEP 1 — Look, then test

*(Screen: run the plot.)*

Look first. Always look first.

*(Trace the series.)*

The level wanders. It drifts up, it drifts back, there's no fixed value it returns to. Your eye
says non-stationary. Now make the test agree — because your eye is not evidence you can put in a
report.

*(Run the two ADF cells.)*

```
levels                       ADF   -1.33   p  0.614   lags 12   UNIT ROOT
first difference             ADF   -5.00   p  0.000   lags 11   stationary
```

**[pause]**

Read those two lines carefully, because this is what a *clean* case looks like and you want it
in your memory for comparison later.

In levels: ADF statistic minus one point three three, p-value point six one. Nowhere near
significance. We fail to reject the null of a unit root — the series is non-stationary, exactly
as your eye said.

First difference: minus five point zero zero, p-value effectively zero. Decisive. One difference
was enough.

That tells you *d* equals one, and you now have an evidence trail for that choice rather than a
hunch. You'll be asked to justify a *d* in the homework. This is what the justification looks
like.

---

# ▶ STEP 2 — Now you are allowed to read the ACF

*(Screen: run the four-panel figure.)*

Four panels. Top row is the raw series, bottom row is differenced.

*(Point at the top-left panel.)*

Look at the top ACF. It crawls down — a long slow decay, bar after bar, staying well above the
significance band for twenty-plus lags.

Here's the trap. That pattern looks like enormously strong autocorrelation, and a reasonable
person reads it as "there's a lot of structure here to model." **It isn't.** That slow decay is
the signature of an *undifferenced* series, and it appears no matter what the underlying process
is. A random walk produces it. An AR(1) with a unit root produces it. White noise plus a trend
produces it.

It tells you nothing about *p* or *q*. It tells you only that you skipped a step.

*(Point at the bottom row.)*

Now the bottom row, after differencing. That is interpretable. The bars drop into the band
quickly and you can actually read structure off it.

**[STOP — learner works]** — *(replaces "say it out loud to the person next to you")*

Pause the video. Using the bottom row and the four reference patterns from Lecture 2, propose a
*(p, d, q)*.

Write it down before you continue, and write down *why* — which panel, which lags. Then post it
in the Week 2 thread. I want to see the range of proposals, because there genuinely is one, and
that's part of the lesson.

---

# ▶ STEP 3 — Fit it

*(Screen: show the `order` line.)*

Line one of this cell is `order = (1, 1, 1)`. **Replace it with your proposal.** The lab ships
with (1,1,1) as a placeholder so the file renders for everyone — it is not the answer.

*(Run the cell.)*

*(Note for the narrator: with the shipped (1,1,1) the 52-week RMSE is **569**. Say your own
number aloud, then say the following.)*

Your number will differ from mine if you chose a different order, and that is fine — that is the
exercise. What you should be able to do is say why you chose what you chose.

---

# ▶ STEP 4 — Break it: the horizon trap

*(Screen: run the walk-forward loop. It fits an ARIMA at every origin — this takes a moment.)*

Same model. Different evaluation. Watch what happens to the number.

```
walk-forward 1-step RMSE : 352   (172 origins)
single-split 52-step RMSE: 569
```

**[pause]**

Three fifty-two against five sixty-nine. The walk-forward number is nearly forty percent smaller,
and it is computed from a hundred and seventy-two separate forecasts instead of one — so it even
*looks* more rigorous. More origins, more evaluation, smaller error.

It is enormously tempting to quote it. Do not.

They are not two estimates of the same thing. They answer different questions. One-step-ahead —
knowing everything up to last week, forecasting next week — is a fundamentally easier problem
than standing at a fixed origin and forecasting fifty-two weeks out. Of course the error is
smaller. It would be alarming if it weren't.

The question is which one matches the decision. If a planner is ordering inventory twelve months
ahead, **the 52-step number is the honest one**, and quoting 352 to that person is not
optimistic — it's wrong.

**[pause]**

This is the most common way I see forecast accuracy overstated in practice, and almost nobody
does it dishonestly. They compute the number that's easy to compute, and it happens to be the
flattering one.

# ▶ STEP 5 — Granger causality, and the trap in it

*(Screen: show the helper function.)*

Does the food aisle help predict the household aisle?

First, the practical note. `grangercausalitytests` prints four test variants for every lag up to
`maxlag` — for lag 4, that's a screen and a half of output nobody asked for. The helper
swallows it with `redirect_stdout` and pulls out the single F-test we want. That's what those
imports were for.

*(Run it.)*

```
      food -> household  F =  3.83   p = 0.0048   significant
```

Now the argument order, and please write this down: **the second argument is the candidate
cause.** `granger("household", "food")` asks whether food helps predict household. Getting this
backwards is the single most common mistake with this function, and it is silent — you get a
perfectly reasonable-looking result to the wrong question.

**[STOP — learner works]**

Your turn. Run the other direction and report both F-statistics. It's one line — uncomment and
swap the arguments.

*(Screen: after the pause, run it.)*

```
 household -> food        F =  2.80   p = 0.0263   significant
```

**[pause]**

Both directions are significant. Food predicts household, and household predicts food.

Sit with how strange that is. Household goods do not cause groceries. Groceries do not cause
household goods. Nobody buys paper towels *because* they bought bananas. And yet the test says
each helps predict the other, at conventional significance, in both directions.

We'll come back to what's generating that. Hold the question.

---

# ▶ STEP 6 — The same test on macro data, and why the sample matters

*(Screen: run the FRED cell.)*

Now the question from the lecture slide, on real macro data. Does unemployment Granger-cause
retail sales?

Both series arrive already stationary — retail growth is log-differenced monthly percent change,
unemployment is the monthly change in the rate. So we can test directly.

```
Full sample: 1992-02 to 2026-06 (412 months)
   unrate_diff -> retail_growth   F =  18.22   p = 0.0000   significant
 retail_growth -> unrate_diff     F =  12.80   p = 0.0000   significant
```

**[pause]**

Both directions significant, and unemployment is the stronger of the two — F of eighteen against
thirteen. That matches the story everybody expects. People lose jobs, people stop spending. You
could write that paragraph without running anything, which is exactly why you should be
suspicious of how satisfying it is.

**Now drop the COVID window.**

*(Run the ex-COVID cell.)*

```
Excluding Feb 2020 - Jun 2021 (395 months)
   unrate_diff -> retail_growth   F =   2.91   p = 0.0214   significant
 retail_growth -> unrate_diff     F =   6.74   p = 0.0000   significant
```

Seventeen months removed out of four hundred and twelve — four percent of the sample. The
unemployment-to-retail F-statistic falls from **18.22 to 2.91.** It's still significant, barely,
but it has lost about six-sevenths of its strength.

The reverse direction went from 12.80 to 6.74. Weaker, but still overwhelming.

**[STOP — learner works]**

Your turn. Restrict to everything *before* February 2020 — no COVID period at all, no recovery
either — and run both directions.

*(Screen: after the pause, run it.)*

```
Pre-COVID, before Feb 2020 (336 months)
   unrate_diff -> retail_growth   F =   1.85   p = 0.1196   NOT significant
 retail_growth -> unrate_diff     F =   9.67   p = 0.0000   significant
```

**[pause]** — *let this sit.*

Eighteen point two two. Two point nine one. One point eight five.

On twenty-eight years of pre-pandemic data, unemployment does **not** Granger-cause retail sales.
The intuitive direction — the one everybody expects, the one that has a mechanism, the one you'd
put in a slide without checking — is gone.

And the direction nobody leads with, retail predicting unemployment, survives every single cut:
12.80, then 6.74, then 9.67. Never above a p-value of point zero zero zero one.

---

# ▶ BEFORE YOU LEAVE

*(Screen: the closing callouts.)*

Two questions, and I want both in the Week 2 thread before Lecture 3.

**[STOP — learner works]** — *(replaces "Discuss (Step 5)")*

**First, the aisles.** You found a two-way relationship between household goods and groceries.
Neither causes the other. So what is generating it?

And the commercial half, which is the one that matters: given what you found, is there anything a
planner is *entitled* to do with it? Name one legitimate use and one thing they must not
conclude.

**[STOP — learner works]** — *(replaces "Discuss (Step 6)")*

**Second, the macro result.** One analyst runs the full sample and reports that unemployment
predicts retail sales. Another runs 1992 to 2019 and reports that it does not.

**Neither of them has made an error.** Both ran the correct test, correctly, on a defensible
sample. That's what makes this worth twenty minutes of your attention rather than being a
cautionary tale about sloppy work.

What actually happened — and what does it tell you about a Granger result computed on a sample
containing one enormous shared shock?

One hint worth using: retail sales are a coincident-to-leading indicator, and unemployment is a
*lagging* one. Firms cut hours and stop hiring after demand falls, not before. Does that help
explain which direction survived every cut?

**[pause]**

Solutions for the coded parts go up on Canvas after the deadline. Lecture 3 next, where we leave
retail data entirely — because it can't show you what we need to see.

# Appendix — expected output

Reproducible; verified across repeated runs. **Step 3 excepted** — that number depends on the
order the student chooses.

| Quantity | Value |
|---|---|
| Series | CA_1 HOUSEHOLD, 277 weeks (train 225, test 52) |
| ADF levels | −1.33, p = 0.614, 12 lags → unit root |
| ADF first difference | −5.00, p < 0.001, 11 lags → stationary |
| ARIMA(1,1,1) 52-step RMSE | 569 *(shipped placeholder order only)* |
| Walk-forward 1-step RMSE | 352, over 172 origins |
| food → household | F = 3.83, p = 0.0048 |
| household → food | F = 2.80, p = 0.0263 |
| **Macro, full sample (412 mo)** | unrate→retail F = 18.22 · retail→unrate F = 12.80 |
| **Ex-COVID (395 mo)** | unrate→retail F = 2.91 (p = 0.0214) · retail→unrate F = 6.74 |
| **Pre-COVID (336 mo)** | unrate→retail F = 1.85 (**p = 0.1196, not significant**) · retail→unrate F = 9.67 |

**Note for the instructor.** The FRED full sample ends 2026-06, so it moves as `prep_fred.py` is
re-run. The three F-statistics will drift slightly between terms; the *pattern* — collapse in one
direction, survival in the other — is what's stable, and it's what the discussion questions rest
on. Re-run this appendix before recording if the cache is more than a term old.

**Three things to know before recording.**

*Step 6 is the only place in the course where a Granger verdict flips with the sample window.*
`UNRATE` to `RSXFS` is significant on 1992-2026 and gone before 2020, because COVID supplies one
enormous shared shock. That is the point of leaving M5 for one step — no retail series in this
course has an episode that can teach it — so protect its screen time.

*The clean ADF verdict here is deliberate, and worth naming.* CA_1 HOUSEHOLD gives the same answer
at every lag order. Homework 1 uses the messier series where the verdict flips, so students meet
the unambiguous case first and have something to compare against when it stops being
unambiguous.

*Granger causality is not causality, and the lab's own title says "the trap in it".* Say the
disclaimer in the same breath as the result, not after it — a student who writes "unemployment
causes retail sales" in Homework 1 has taken the wrong sentence away.
