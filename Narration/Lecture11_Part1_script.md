## How to use this document

- **`▶ SLIDE n — Title`** marks where to advance. The number is the PDF page.
- *Italic parentheticals* are stage directions. **[pause]** means stop for a beat.
- Slide 4 sets expectations low on purpose and slide 15 collects on it. The argument of this
  lecture is that a **calibrated but useless** interval is still a better deliverable than a point
  forecast, because you can *establish* that it's useless. Do not soften that.
- Slide 12 is the first of two sampler failures in this pair of lectures. Treat it as a rehearsal

# ▶ SLIDE 1 — Title page

Lecture 11, Part 1: Bayesian Statistics II — Time Series.

Last week we built the machinery — Bayes' theorem, priors, MCMC, and the three diagnostics. All of
it on a conversion rate, which is not a time series.

Today we point that machinery at the thing this course is actually about.

**[pause]**

And I'll tell you the ending now, because it's the interesting part. The model we build today will
beat the seasonal-naive benchmark by about four percent. That is a small win, and after ten weeks
of this course you should be suspicious of anyone who presents four percent as a triumph.

The argument for today is not the point forecast. It's what else comes back with it.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 2 — Lecture Outline

Five parts. Why you'd do this at all, given that four percent. Then the structural decomposition —
writing a series as parts you can name. Then fitting it in PyMC, where our first attempt fails.
Then reading the forecast, and the two very different questions you can ask about an interval. And
takeaways.

# ▶ SLIDE 3 — Section divider: Why Bayesian Time Series

Not a more accurate forecast — a different deliverable.

# ▶ SLIDE 4 — What Every Model So Far Gave You

Take stock for a second. Ten weeks of forecasting, and almost every model has returned the same
object: **one number per period.**

ETS, ARIMA, random forests, XGBoost, the LSTM — a point forecast. And at best, an interval derived
from asymptotic theory that, let's be honest, nobody checked.

**[pause]**

For a planner, that is often not enough. Consider the question: *how much stock do I need so the
chance of a stockout is under five percent?*

That is a question about a **distribution**. A point forecast cannot answer it — not because the
point forecast is inaccurate, but because it isn't the right kind of object. You can't extract a
fifth percentile from a single number.

*(Point at the key box.)*

A Bayesian time series model returns a full predictive distribution for every future period, plus
a distribution over each *component* — the trend, the seasonality, the noise, each with its own
uncertainty.

**[pause]**

*(Now set expectations honestly. This paragraph is load-bearing.)*

And let me set expectations properly, right now.

This will not beat XGBoost on RMSE. On our data it barely beats seasonal naive. The argument for
it is what it hands you, not where it ranks.

I'm saying that at the start because at the end of this lecture I'm going to hold it to exactly
that standard — and it's going to partially fail. That's a more useful hour than one where
everything works.

# ▶ SLIDE 5 — Three Things That Become Possible

Three capabilities you didn't have before.

*(Walk the table.)*

**Priors carry knowledge.** "Weekly growth is very unlikely to exceed twenty percent" is a sentence
you can put *into the model*, rather than hoping the data implies it. When you have short history,
that's the difference between a usable forecast and a wild one.

**Components get error bars.** Not just a forecast, but "how confident am I that there's a trend at
all?" — separately from the seasonality. You can decompose your uncertainty, not just your signal.

**Uncertainty compounds honestly.** Forecast fifty-two weeks out and the interval widens, because
the model propagates uncertainty forward rather than assuming it away.

**[pause]**

*(Point at the third row again — it's the one to dwell on.)*

That third row is the one people underestimate, so let me sharpen it.

An ARIMA prediction interval widens too. But it widens according to a **formula**, derived under
assumptions about the error process that you did not check and probably could not check.

Here, the widening is a *consequence of the model you wrote down*. If you said the level follows a
random walk, then fifty-two steps of random walk uncertainty is what you get. You can trace the
interval back to a modelling choice and argue about that choice.

**[pause]**

That traceability is worth more than it sounds. When a planner tells you the interval is too wide
to use — which is exactly what will happen at the end of this lecture — you can point at the
specific assumption producing it and propose changing *that*, rather than shrugging at a formula.

An ARIMA interval you can only accept or reject. This one you can negotiate with.

*(Point at the price.)*

And the price is real: it's slower, it needs priors you must defend, and — as we'll see in twenty
minutes — it can fail silently in ways a least-squares fit simply cannot.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 6 — Section divider: The Structural Decomposition

Write the series as a sum of parts you can name, and put a prior on each.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 7 — Structural Time Series: One Equation

The whole idea is additive, and you have seen this shape before.

*(Point at the equation.)*

y-t equals mu-t, the level, plus s-t, the seasonality, plus epsilon-t, the noise.

That is the GAM decomposition from Lecture 3, with priors attached. Same additive structure, same
named components — now each one is a random variable with a distribution.

**[pause]**

And here's why that matters practically. **Each piece is a thing a business person can name**, and
each gets its own posterior.

"Demand is growing" is a statement about mu-t. "December is our peak" is a statement about s-t.
"How noisy is this store?" is sigma. Those are three separate questions, and the model answers
them separately, with uncertainty on each.

*(Point at the key box.)*

That's why the approach is called **structural**. You are not fitting a flexible curve to data and
hoping. You are stating what you believe the series is *made of*, and asking the data how much of
each part there is.

**[pause]**

Contrast ARIMA, which we spent Lecture 2 on. There, trend and seasonality are handled by
*differencing* — you remove them rather than model them — and the parameters that come out are
autocorrelation coefficients. Nobody has ever walked into a planning meeting and explained the
business implications of an MA(2) coefficient.

Here, every parameter is a quantity somebody outside the room can interpret.

**[pause]**

There's a real trade being made, though, and I don't want to sell only one side.

ARIMA's differencing is *automatic*. You don't have to know whether the trend is linear or
wandering or damped — you difference, and the trend is gone, whatever shape it had.

Structural modelling makes you **commit**. You have to say what kind of level you believe in
before you fit. Commit correctly and you get interpretable components and honest uncertainty.
Commit wrongly and you have baked a false assumption into the model, and the posterior will look
perfectly confident about it.

That's the same bargain as the DAG in Lecture 12: stating your assumptions gets you more, and
makes you responsible for them.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 8 — The Level: A Random Walk With a Prior On It

The simplest useful trend is a **local level**: the series has a level, and the level itself
drifts over time.

mu-t equals mu-t-minus-one plus a shock. Read as a sentence: **this week's level is last week's
level, plus a random disturbance.**

And that disturbance has a standard deviation, sigma-level, which you put a prior on. That single
parameter controls **how fast the level is allowed to move**.

*(Walk the two rows.)*

Small sigma-level: a nearly constant level. Rigid, but stable far into the future.

Large sigma-level: a level that chases recent data. Fits the training period beautifully, and the
forecasts wander off.

**[pause]**

*(Point at the callback.)*

And that is a familiar trade in new clothing.

It is the smoothing parameter from Lecture 1's exponential smoothing — alpha, deciding how fast to
forget. It is the penalty strength from Lecture 6. Now it's expressed as a **prior you can argue
about**, and — importantly — the data gets a say in it too, because sigma-level is estimated, not
fixed.

That's the sixth appearance of this idea coming into view. We'll name it properly next week.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 9 — Seasonality as Fourier Terms

Now seasonality. Our data is weekly with an annual cycle, so a naive approach would estimate
fifty-two separate seasonal parameters. That's a lot to estimate, and most of it would be noise.

Instead, build the seasonal shape out of a few smooth waves.

*(Point at the equation.)*

s-t is a sum over k of sine and cosine terms at increasing frequencies. P is the period —
fifty-two for us. K is how many waves you allow. K equals one is a single smooth annual cycle;
larger K lets the shape get more detailed, with sharper peaks.

And each a-k and b-k is just a coefficient with a Normal prior. Nothing exotic.

**[pause]**

*(Point at the key box — this is the third time they've seen this device.)*

You have met this exact construction **twice already**.

It is how Prophet encodes seasonality, in Lecture 3. And it is the Fourier feature block you
engineered by hand for Homework 4 — those `sin_1`, `cos_1`, `sin_2` columns.

Same device, third appearance. The difference now is that a-k and b-k come back as
**distributions**, so you can ask how confident you are that the seasonal peak is where you think
it is.

*(Point at the last line.)*

K trades flexibility against overfitting, exactly like spline knots in Lecture 3. We use K equals
three — six coefficients standing in for fifty-two parameters.

**[pause]**

Notice what that construction *assumes*, because it's an assumption and not a free lunch: it
assumes the seasonal shape is **smooth**.

Three sine-cosine pairs can describe a broad annual hump with a couple of gentle bumps. What they
cannot describe is a single enormous one-week spike — Black Friday, say — sitting on an otherwise
flat year. Fourier terms will smear that spike across neighbouring weeks, because smooth curves
are all they can make.

If your business has sharp calendar events, the honest answer is to model them as **separate
indicator variables** rather than raising K until the waves can approximate a spike. That's what
Prophet does with its holiday regressors, and it's what you did by hand with the SNAP and event
flags in Homework 2.

# ▶ SLIDE 10 — Section divider: Fitting It in PyMC

The model in code, and the check you run before believing any of it.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 11 — The Model in PyMC

Here is everything from the last three slides, in about eight lines.

*(Walk the code.)*

`sigma_level` with an Exponential prior — it must be positive, so Exponential, not Normal. Then
`z`, a vector of standard Normals. Then the level is the **cumulative sum** of z times
sigma_level.

Stop on that line for a second, because it's the clever bit: `cumsum` of scaled Normal draws **is**
a random walk. That's the definition. Each step adds a scaled Normal shock to the running total.

Then `beta`, the Fourier coefficients. Then sigma, the observation noise. Then the likelihood: the
observed data is Normal around level plus the Fourier terms.

**[pause]**

*(This warning is practical and easy to get wrong.)*

One thing you must do, and it's bolded for a reason. **Standardize y first.**

These priors assume the data is on roughly unit scale. Our weekly units are in the tens of
thousands. An Exponential prior with rate ten on `sigma_level` is a sensible prior for a
standardized series and an absurdly tight one for raw units of twenty thousand — you'd be telling
the model the level essentially cannot move.

Standardize, fit, then transform the forecasts back. Getting this wrong produces a model that
fits terribly for reasons that look mysterious.

**[pause]**

This is the same lesson as Lecture 6's warning about standardizing before Ridge, and it will come
back one more time in Lecture 12 with the opposite sign — where standardizing a variable you then
*interpret* silently destroys the interpretation.

So the rule isn't "always standardize" or "never." It's: **know what scale each variable is on,
and know what your priors assume about that scale.** A prior is a statement about magnitudes. If
you don't know the magnitudes, you don't know what you've assumed.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 12 — The First Fit Failed — Here Is What That Looks Like

*(This is the honest-failure slide. Deliver it as a story, not a footnote.)*

Now something worth your attention.

The obvious way to write this model uses `pm.GaussianRandomWalk`, which is exactly what it sounds
like and exactly what the equation says. We wrote it that way first. And it sampled **badly** —
even with `target_accept` raised to point-nine-five.

*(Walk the table.)*

R-hat: one-point-oh-two-two, against a threshold of one-point-oh-one. Failed. ESS: two hundred
fifty-two, against four hundred. Failed. Divergences: zero — that one passed.

After the fix: R-hat one-point-oh-oh-two, ESS two thousand six hundred seventeen.

**[pause]**

*(Now the important part.)*

Here is what I want you to take from this.

**Nothing crashed.** The model returned a forecast. The forecast, plotted, looked entirely
reasonable — a sensible level, a sensible seasonal shape, plausible intervals. If we had not run
the diagnostics, we would have shipped it and never known.

The only thing that told us was R-hat saying the four chains had not agreed with each other.

That is precisely why Lecture 10 made those three numbers non-negotiable. This is the failure mode
they exist for.

*(Point at the warning box.)*

**[pause]**

And the fix is worth understanding, because you'll meet it again next week.

The fix was **reparameterization**, not more samples. Not a longer run, not a smaller step size —
a different way of writing the *same model*.

Writing the walk as `cumsum(z * sigma)`, with z a standard Normal, is called the **non-centred**
form. It gives the sampler a geometry it can actually navigate. Identical model, identical
posterior in principle, completely different sampling behaviour.

BMCP section four-point-six-point-one covers exactly this, and next week we'll see the same fix
applied to a hierarchy — where it will matter even more.

# ▶ SLIDE 13 — Section divider: Reading the Forecast

The point estimate, the interval, and whether either is any use.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 14 — Does It Work? The Point Forecast

CA_1 FOODS, fifty-two weeks held out.

*(Point at the table.)*

Bayesian structural model: RMSE one thousand five hundred eighty-seven. Seasonal naive — same week
last year, one line of code: one thousand six hundred sixty.

So we beat the benchmark by about **four percent**.

**[pause]**

That is a real improvement and a small one. And I'll repeat what I said at the start: after ten
weeks of this course, you should be suspicious of anyone who reports four percent as a triumph.

*(Now the fair-hearing paragraph. Give it properly.)*

But let me also be fair to the model, because the comparison isn't like-for-like.

Look at what this model was *given*: the series, and a calendar. That's it. No lag features. No
price. No SNAP flags. No store identity. No cross-series information.

The XGBoost model in Homework 4 had forty-six engineered predictors and thirty series to learn
from, and beat naive by a much wider margin. It also had a great deal more information.

**[pause]**

And there's nothing stopping you from combining them, which is what a serious production system
usually does. Add price and promotion regressors to this structural model and the level has less
work to do, so it drifts less, so the interval narrows. You keep the predictive distribution and
you buy back some accuracy.

We're not doing that today because I want the mechanism visible rather than buried under
covariates. But it is the obvious next step, and it's a very reasonable direction for a final
project.

**[pause]**

So: the point forecast is not the reason to do this. Which brings us to the slide that is.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 15 — The Interval Is the Product

Every forecast comes with a ninety-four percent predictive interval. And there are **two**
questions you can ask about it, which are different questions, and this is the heart of the
lecture.

*(Walk the table.)*

**Is it calibrated?** Measured: one hundred percent of held-out weeks fell inside the interval.
Reading: not overconfident. Though it should be about ninety-four percent, so it's actually
*conservative* — a bit too wide.

**Is it useful?** Measured: the width is roughly eleven thousand seven hundred units, on a mean of
nineteen thousand seven hundred. That's about **plus or minus thirty percent**. Honest, and far too
wide to order against.

**[pause]**

*(This is the sentence of the lecture.)*

**Passing the first does not excuse failing the second.**

A model that says "demand next week will be somewhere between fourteen thousand and twenty-six
thousand" is telling you the truth and helping nobody. You cannot write a purchase order against
that.

And the cause is structural, not a bug. A level that is free to random-walk for fifty-two steps
*drifts*, and the accumulated uncertainty is genuinely that large. The model is correctly
reporting the consequence of what we told it to believe.

So the fix is a model with a **stronger opinion**: a damped level that reverts rather than
wandering, or covariates that pin it down — price, promotions, the things we withheld.

**[pause]**

*(And now the payoff. Slow down.)*

But notice what just happened, because this is the argument for the entire lecture.

**We could ask whether the uncertainty was honest.** We computed coverage against held-out data,
and got an answer.

For every point-forecast model in this course — every single one, from ETS through the Transformer
— that question had **no answer at all**. There was nothing to check. You got a number, and the
number was right or wrong, and that was the end of the conversation.

A calibrated-but-too-wide interval is a worse forecast and a better *deliverable*, because it tells
you something true about how much you actually know. That is worth paying four percent for.

What structural models are for.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 17 — Lecture 11 Part 1: Key Takeaways

One. A structural model writes the series as named parts — level, seasonality, noise — and gives
each one a prior and a posterior.

Two. The local level is a random walk whose step size you put a prior on. Small means rigid, large
means it chases the data. Same trade as a smoothing parameter or a penalty.

Three. Fourier terms encode seasonality in a few coefficients instead of fifty-two. Same device as
Prophet in Lecture 3 and the features you built in Homework 4 — third appearance.

Four. **Check the sampler before the forecast.** Our first fit had R-hat one-point-oh-two and ESS
two fifty-two, while returning a perfectly plausible-looking answer. Reparameterizing fixed it.

Five. The point forecast beat seasonal naive by four percent. That is not the argument.

And six. The interval was **calibrated but too wide to act on** — and being able to *establish*
that is the actual product.

**[pause]**

Next time: hierarchical models. What to do when you have thirty series and some of them barely
have any data — and a question you have to answer *before* you fit anything.
