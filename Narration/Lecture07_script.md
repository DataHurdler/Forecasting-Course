# ▶ SLIDE 1 — Title page

Lecture 7: Introduction to Neural Networks.

This is the start of the second half of the course, and I want to set expectations before we
begin, because this topic arrives with more hype attached than anything else we'll cover.

For the last three weeks you've been building tree models — random forests, gradient boosting,
regularized regression. Those work extremely well on the kind of data we have. Today we start on
neural networks, and by the end of the next two lectures you will have fitted several of them.

**[pause]**

Here's what I want you to hold onto. Nothing today makes your XGBoost model obsolete. On our
data, the networks are going to lose. What today buys you is the machinery — and the machinery
matters because of what we do with it in Lectures 8 and 9, where the *architecture* starts
carrying assumptions that a flat table cannot.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 2 — Lecture Outline

Five parts. First, why you'd go beyond trees at all — and when you shouldn't. Then the
feedforward network itself: layers, width, depth, and how quickly the parameter count runs away
from you. Then training — loss, backpropagation, the update step. Then PyTorch, which is four
pieces you'll use in every deep learning assignment for the rest of the semester. And then where
a network actually belongs in the toolkit you now have.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 3 — Section divider: From Trees to Neural Networks

*(Advance and read the subtitle aloud — it's the thesis of the whole lecture.)*

Trees predict in steps. Networks predict in curves. And that difference buys you less than you
would expect on tabular data, and everything on sequences.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 4 — Why Go Beyond Trees?

Two honest reasons, and one honest warning.

The first reason: a tree-based model treats every row as independent. Order is not part of the
model. Everything a random forest knows about *time* — that last week matters, that fifty-two
weeks ago matters — you put there by hand, as lag columns and rolling means. If you shuffled the
feature columns, the model would be identical.

The second reason: a tree's prediction is **piecewise constant**. Remember Lab 4, where the tree
could not predict above the largest value it had ever seen? That's not a bug in our
implementation. It is what a tree is. It averages training values in a leaf, so it cannot
extrapolate. A neural network learns a smooth, continuous function, and it can.

**[pause]**

Now the warning, and I want to be blunt about it.

*(Point at the warning box.)*

This is **not an upgrade**. On the tabular problems in Homework 3 and Homework 4, gradient
boosting and a tuned LASSO were hard to beat, and a network will often lose to both. You reach
for a network when the data is genuinely a sequence, when the raw input is an image or audio, or
when your sample size is very large. Otherwise you are paying in tuning time for accuracy you
will not get.

So today is about the machinery. Lectures 8 and 9 are where it earns its place.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 5 — From Linear Regression to a Single Neuron

Let's build the thing from something you already know.

Linear regression predicts y-hat equals w-transpose x plus b. A weighted sum of your predictors,
plus an intercept. You've been fitting that since Lecture 2.

A **neuron** is that exact expression with one addition: a nonlinear function wrapped around the
outside. We call that function the **activation**, and we write it sigma.

So: a equals sigma of w-transpose x plus b. That's it. That is the entire unit.

*(Walk the activation table.)*

Four activations you'll meet. **ReLU** — max of zero and z — is the default for hidden layers.
**Sigmoid** squashes to between zero and one; you'll see it again in Lecture 9 as an LSTM gate.
**Tanh** squashes to between minus one and one, and shows up in sequence states. And **linear**,
which is just z — that's your output layer when you're doing regression, because you don't want
to squash a forecast.

**[pause]**

ReLU is worth a sentence of intuition, because it makes the whole thing concrete. The neuron is
asking a question: *is this pattern present?* If the evidence is positive, it passes a signal
through, proportional to how positive. If the evidence is negative, it outputs exactly zero and
stays silent. That's a detector.

**[pause]**

And that "exactly zero" is doing more work than it looks. Because ReLU switches fully off, a
trained network is **sparse** at any given input — most neurons contribute nothing, and the ones
that fire are the ones whose pattern is present. That sparsity is part of why ReLU trains faster
than sigmoid: a sigmoid never quite switches off, so every unit is always slightly involved in
every prediction, and its gradient gets very small at both extremes.

One thing to watch on the output layer. It is genuinely tempting to put an activation there
because every other layer has one. Don't. A ReLU on the output would make negative forecasts
impossible, which sounds harmless until you remember we often model *log* units or *differences*,
where negative is exactly what you want. Regression output layers stay linear.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 6 — Why the Nonlinearity Is the Whole Trick

I want to be precise about what that sigma actually buys, because it is easy to assume that
*depth* is what makes a network powerful. It is not.

*(Point at the definition box.)*

Here is the thing to understand. A linear function of a linear function is linear. If you stack
two layers with no activation between them, you get W-two times W-one times x — and W-two times
W-one is just some other matrix. So you have a single matrix, applied once. You've built a linear
model with extra steps and a slower fitting procedure.

Depth alone gains you **nothing**.

**[pause]**

Put a nonlinearity between the layers and the picture changes completely. There's a result called
the **universal approximation theorem** which says a network with a single hidden layer can
approximate any continuous function to arbitrary accuracy, given enough neurons.

Now — read that claim carefully, because it is quoted far more often than it is understood.

It says the network **can represent** the function. It does not say your optimizer will find it.
It does not say you have enough data to identify it. And it certainly does not say the result
will generalize to next quarter.

Existence is not estimation. You've already met that gap: in Lecture 4 we said the optimal
decision tree exists, and CART builds a greedy one instead, because finding the optimal one is
computationally hopeless. Same shape of problem, different setting.

**[pause]**

There's a practical reading of the theorem too, and it's more useful than the theoretical one.
The theorem is about a *single* hidden layer, made arbitrarily wide. In practice nobody builds
that. Everybody builds narrow-and-deep instead, because depth composes features — layer two
builds on what layer one found, rather than starting over — and that turns out to need far fewer
total neurons for the same job.

So when someone tells you "neural networks are universal approximators," the correct response is
that so are polynomials, and so are splines, and you would not use a degree-forty polynomial to
forecast demand. Being able to represent everything is not by itself a recommendation. What
matters is whether the shape the model prefers matches the shape your data actually has — which
is exactly the theme of the next two lectures.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 7 — Section divider: Feedforward Networks

Stack layers of neurons, and each layer learns a higher-level representation of the one below it.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 8 — Feedforward Network: Layers and Forward Pass

A **feedforward network** — you'll also see it called an FFN or a multilayer perceptron — is
three things in sequence.

An **input layer**, which is just your raw features. Some number of **hidden layers**, each one
applying that neuron equation to the layer below it — matrix multiply, add a bias, apply the
activation. And an **output layer**, which for regression is linear, no activation.

Two words you need. **Width** is how many neurons are in a layer. **Depth** is how many hidden
layers you have. Together they set the model's capacity — the range of functions it can represent.

*(Point at the key box.)*

Sensible starting sizes for forecasting: two to three hidden layers, sixty-four to two hundred
fifty-six neurons each, ReLU activations, dropout somewhere between zero-point-two and
zero-point-five.

**Start at the small end of every one of those ranges.**

**[pause]**

Because here's the trap. Bigger is not better on its own. A wider or deeper network needs *more
data* and *more regularization* to reach the same generalization. So you add capacity when
validation error tells you the current model is genuinely too simple — not because the capacity
is available and it's one keystroke away.

**[pause]**

Here's the diagnostic that tells you which way to move. Look at training error and validation
error together. If **both** are bad, your model is too simple — add width or depth. If training
error is excellent and validation error is poor, you have the opposite problem, and more capacity
will make it worse; you need more regularization, or more data, or fewer features.

That's the bias-variance picture from Lecture 4, and it does not change just because the model
has twenty thousand parameters instead of twenty leaves. Only the knobs change.

The reason I push you toward the small end is practical. A small network that underfits tells you
so clearly and trains in seconds. A large network that overfits produces a beautiful training
curve and a forecast you shouldn't ship, and it takes ten times as long to discover that.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 9 — How Big Is This Model, Actually?

Capacity is easy to add by accident, so let's count it once, properly.

A layer mapping m inputs to n outputs holds m times n weights, plus n biases. That's it — that's
the whole formula.

*(Walk the table.)*

Take a network for our weekly panel. Forty-six engineered features going in — the same features
you built for Homework 4. Two hidden layers of a hundred twenty-eight. One output.

Input to hidden one: forty-six times one hundred twenty-eight, that's six thousand and sixteen
parameters. Hidden one to hidden two: one twenty-eight squared, sixteen thousand five hundred
twelve. Hidden two to output: one hundred twenty-nine.

Total: **twenty-two thousand six hundred fifty-seven parameters.**

**[pause]**

Now sit with that number for a second. We have about five thousand rows of training data. That's
roughly **four parameters for every observation**.

In Lecture 6 I described sixty predictors on a hundred and fifty observations as a crisis — the
situation where ordinary least squares falls apart and you *must* regularize. This is far past
that ratio. And networks train in this regime routinely, every day, in production.

What makes it survivable is not the architecture. It's the regularization. Which is next.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 10 — Section divider: Training — Loss and Backpropagation

Compute the error, propagate it backward, adjust every weight by its share of the blame. Repeat.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 11 — Training: Loss, Gradients, and the Update Step

Training is one loop, repeated. Three steps.

**First**, compute the loss. For regression that's mean squared error — the average squared gap
between prediction and truth. Nothing new.

**Second**, backpropagation. You work *backward* through the network, using the chain rule from
calculus to assign each weight its share of the error. That's all backprop is: the chain rule,
applied systematically, right to left.

**Third**, you nudge every weight against its gradient. W becomes W minus eta times the
derivative of the loss with respect to W. Eta is the **learning rate** — how big a step you take.

*(Point at the definition box.)*

One refinement. Rather than using the whole dataset to compute each update, you use a random
**mini-batch** — typically thirty-two to two hundred fifty-six rows. The steps are noisier, but
you take far more of them and each one is much cheaper. That's **stochastic gradient descent**.
One full pass through every batch is called an **epoch**.

**[pause]**

And here's the practical part: **you never differentiate anything by hand.** Calling
`loss.backward()` does the entire backward pass for you. That's what a deep learning framework
*is*, fundamentally — it records every operation you performed on the way forward so it can walk
that record backward and apply the chain rule automatically.

**[pause]**

Two words about the learning rate, because it is the hyperparameter that will waste the most of
your time if you get it wrong.

Too large, and the loss jumps around or diverges outright — you overshoot the minimum on every
step. Too small, and training is correct but glacial, and you'll conclude the model doesn't work
when actually you just didn't wait. If your loss curve is spiky or turns into `nan`, lower the
learning rate by a factor of ten before you change anything else.

In practice you won't use plain SGD anyway. `torch.optim.Adam` with a learning rate of
one-e-minus-three adapts the step size separately for each parameter, and it is the sensible
default for everything in this course. It is more forgiving of a badly chosen learning rate than
plain SGD, which is most of why it became standard.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 12 — Preventing Overfitting — Where Lecture 6 Returns

Twenty-two thousand parameters on five thousand rows will memorize the training set unless
something stops it. Three things do — and **you have already met two of them.**

*(Walk the table slowly. This slide is the point of the lecture.)*

`weight_decay`. This is **Ridge regression**. It is an L2 penalty on the network's weights, under
a different name, passed as an argument to the optimizer. Same mathematics, same effect, new
label.

`nn.Dropout(p)`. On each forward pass, randomly zero out a fraction p of the neuron outputs. The
consequence is that no neuron can rely on any specific other neuron being present, so the network
can't build fragile chains of dependency. At test time you turn it off and all neurons are active.

**Early stopping.** Watch validation loss every epoch. When it stops improving for some number of
epochs, stop — and critically, keep the weights from the *best* epoch, not the last one.

**[pause]**

*(Now the callback. Slow down here.)*

That is the **fifth appearance of one idea** in this course.

The GAM smoothing penalty in Lecture 3, which penalized wiggliness. Cost-complexity pruning in
Lecture 4, which penalized the number of leaves. `reg_lambda` in Lecture 5, penalizing leaf
weights. Ridge and LASSO in Lecture 6, penalizing coefficient size. And now weight decay,
penalizing network weights.

Five model families that look nothing like each other. One bargain underneath: **fit against
complexity, with a single parameter setting the exchange rate, chosen by validation.**

You'll see it a sixth time in Lecture 11, and there it will be the cleanest version of all.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 13 — Section divider: PyTorch Implementation

Four pieces: a Dataset, a DataLoader, a model, and a training loop.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 14 — PyTorch: Dataset and DataLoader

*(This is the first of three code slides. Read the structure, not every character.)*

Two objects. A `Dataset` knows how to fetch **one** example — you give it `__len__` so it knows
how many there are, and `__getitem__` so it can hand back item i. A `DataLoader` wraps that and
handles batching, so your training loop can just iterate.

You'll write this exact class, or something very close to it, in Homework 5.

**[pause]**

*(Now the important part.)*

Look at `shuffle=False`.

Nearly every PyTorch tutorial you find online sets that to `True`. For image classification that
is correct — the order of your cat photos is meaningless, and shuffling helps.

For us it is **wrong**, and it will quietly damage your model. Our rows are ordered in time, and
the lag features depend on that ordering. Shuffling destroys it.

This is the same discipline as `TimeSeriesSplit` instead of `KFold`, from Lecture 5. The default
in the tooling assumes your rows are exchangeable. Ours are not.

**[pause]**

And notice the failure mode, because it's the one this course keeps returning to. Setting
`shuffle=True` does not raise an error. It does not warn you. Your model trains, your loss goes
down, and you get a number — a number that is better than it should be, because you have quietly
let the model see the future.

That is the same class of error as `KFold` on a time series, as scaling outside the fold, as an
unshifted rolling feature. None of them crash. All of them return a better-looking answer than
you deserve. Which is exactly why the discipline has to be procedural: you check these things
because they're on a list, not because something broke.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 15 — PyTorch: Defining the Model

Here is the network from slide 9, in five lines.

Read it top to bottom and it *is* the diagram. A linear map to a hundred twenty-eight units. A
ReLU. Some dropout. Then again — linear, ReLU, dropout. Then a final linear layer down to one
output, with no activation on it, because this is regression and we don't want to squash the
forecast.

`nn.Sequential` chains layers in order, and it is enough for anything in this lecture. When you
need an architecture that branches, or that has a skip connection — which is Lecture 8 — you'll
subclass `nn.Module` and write the `forward()` method yourself.

*(Point at the muted footnote.)*

And `nn.Linear(in, out)` is where the weight matrix and bias vector actually live. That's where
those twenty-two thousand six hundred fifty-seven parameters are sitting.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 16 — PyTorch: The Training Loop

And here is the loop. Four steps per mini-batch, and every PyTorch training loop you will ever
read is these four lines with more scaffolding around them.

`zero_grad` — clear the old gradients. Forward pass and compute the loss. `backward` — compute
the new gradients. `step` — update the weights.

That's it. Set up the optimizer with Adam, learning rate one-e-minus-three, weight decay
one-e-minus-four — there's your Ridge penalty. Loss function is MSE.

**[pause]**

*(The last paragraph is the one worth emphasizing.)*

Now the one that bites people.

If you forget `zero_grad()`, PyTorch does not raise an error. It does not warn you. What it does
is **accumulate** gradients across batches instead of replacing them — because gradient
accumulation is a legitimate technique that some people want deliberately.

So your model trains. It just trains badly, and you have no idea why.

We will do this deliberately in the lab, so you can see what the loss curve looks like when it
happens. It is worth seeing once in a controlled setting rather than at eleven at night before a
deadline.

# ▶ SLIDE 17 — Section divider: Key Takeaways

Where a network belongs in the toolkit you now have.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 18 — Neural Networks vs. Tree Methods

*(Walk the table across, then land on the paragraph below it.)*

Five methods, four questions. Does it see sequences? Can it extrapolate beyond the training
range? How much tuning does it need? And what is it actually for?

LASSO and Ridge: no sequences, but they extrapolate, they need almost no tuning, and they're your
answer when you have many correlated predictors. Random forest: no sequences, no extrapolation,
light tuning, and it's the robust tabular default. XGBoost: same, more tuning, best-in-class
accuracy on tabular data. The feedforward network: still no sequences, extrapolates, heavy
tuning, and it's for smooth functions when n is large. And RNNs and LSTMs — which is Lecture 9 —
finally say **yes** in that first column.

**[pause]**

Here's the sentence I want you to leave with.

An FFN on lag features is doing **the same job** as XGBoost on lag features. Same inputs, same
flat table, no notion of order in either one. It is not obviously the better tool, and on the
evidence of Homework 4 it usually is not.

What changes over the next two lectures is not the fitting procedure. It's the **architecture** —
convolutions that see local structure, and recurrence that carries state through time. That is
when the sequence column starts saying yes, and it is precisely why we learned this machinery
today.

**[pause]**

One more column worth dwelling on: **extrapolation**.

Trees and forests say no, and that's not a tuning problem — it's structural. A tree predicts by
averaging the training values that landed in a leaf, so it physically cannot output a number
larger than the largest one it has seen. If your series is trending upward, a random forest will
forecast a flat line at the top of its training range, forever.

The linear models and the networks say yes. A LASSO fit with a trend term will happily project
that trend forward. So will a network.

Whether that is a *feature* depends entirely on whether the trend is real. Extrapolating a
genuine trend is the right answer. Extrapolating a temporary run-up is how forecasts embarrass
people. The model cannot tell the difference — that judgement is yours, and it's the kind of
thing a DAG in Lecture 12 helps you reason about.

---

# ▶ SLIDE 19 — Lecture 7: Key Takeaways

*(Six points. Read them at a steady pace; don't rush the last two.)*

One. A neuron is linear regression wrapped in a nonlinear activation — and without that
nonlinearity, stacking layers collapses back to a single linear model.

Two. An FFN stacks those layers. Width and depth set capacity, and capacity accumulates faster
than you expect. Twenty-two thousand parameters on five thousand rows.

Three. Training is one loop: loss, `backward()`, `step()`, on mini-batches, using Adam. You never
differentiate by hand.

Four. Regularization is not new. Weight decay *is* Ridge; dropout and early stopping do the same
job by other means. That's the fifth appearance of one idea.

Five. For time series specifically: do not shuffle the DataLoader, split by time, and call
`zero_grad()` every batch.

And six — the one that matters most. An FFN on engineered features is a **competitor** to
XGBoost, not an upgrade. Architecture is what earns its keep, and that starts next week.

**[pause]**

Next time: CNN architectures. Convolution, pooling, and what a one-dimensional convolution does
to a time series.
